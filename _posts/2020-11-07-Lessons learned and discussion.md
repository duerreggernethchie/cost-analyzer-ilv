# Lessons learned and discussion

## Zelenne Huhn

### Summary:

This course (ILV and LAB) was for me for sure the most difficult so far in the master and overall in my studies. It was at times very frustrating to pay all my attention and having the feeling of not understanding anything.

It was interesting for me to see how much I could learn and understand because the compromise with my team was so big that I didn't want to disappoint them. I learned as well that I don't need to know all details and don't need to be an expert in all subjects since our team has different roles and everyone of us has his specialty.

It was awesome to see that my team is really willing to support each other by being patient, helping, answering questions, etc. I am really happy to have experienced this since this time I was the one needing help.

I found the quizzes a very good idea! I really liked them because it gave me the chance to refresh in a very easy and fast way the most important concepts from the course.

Thanks to this course, many concepts and words aren't strange to me anymore and I know where to look at when I will be confronted again with this subject.

For me is clear that this course would have been way easier if I would have knowledge of programming, not just the basics. For this reason, during the summer of 2020 I will invest a lot of time learning python.


### Discussion: 

Requirements engineering was for me the easiest part from this course. I've done this for the company I work for and even if we did this as good as we could, we had to do a lot of changes. A system should be adapting itself to the new environments the whole time. As well, it is very complicated to be able to see every single detail when a tool doesn't exist yet.

Web basics was as well easy to follow. These concepts or words are to all known but if you are not confronted with them, it's not easy to know what is meant with it. Would be very cool to know what is the difference between all front ends and platforms for the frameworks, why are there so many? Which is the best? Why? These questions would be great to get answered but maybe it's not so important if you are not doing this as a daily basis.

Software Architecture and design are without a doubt key in every software development project. These can be so complicated that without specialists or a good project management, such a project can be a disaster.

### Summary: 

The software development course is by far the most challenging subject for me but at the same time also the most fullfilling so far. I have always been scared about 
it before having close to zero knowledge of programming and development. There are lot of terms and technologies that i did not know they exist, i did not know what 
it is for and did not know how to apply. It's a good feeling realizing that there are so much more to learn everyday. Although the learning process can be very 
frustrating, atleast i feel very frustrated quite lot of times when i do not understand the topic or things are not working that i even find myself staring at my device for a minute 
or two clicking the mouse anywhere while feeling lost not only once but many times.
But thanks for all the provided articles and tutorials, they really guide me through solving problems like debugging code etc. It is fullfilling for many reasons. 
Not only that i learn lot of things, lot of new technologies, but the thought that I together with my team are brainstorming concepts and developing an app. 
It's a dream come true. I have daydreamed before how software developers make people's live easier. Although i do not see myself into this direction just yet because 
i still need to learn lot of things but getting there as i am learning everyday. 

I also would also like to highlight the teamwork. The course does not only teach me technical skills but also soft skill. The idea of having a team realy molded me 
into a great teamplayer. It is embarassing to admit that i am not good at asking for help (maybe because in the environment where i am moving, there is an unbalance give and take) 
Self-reliance is all i know. With all the challenges i have encountered in software development,  i have started to ask for help from my team and others and started to exchange ideas on what is best for our project. 
Thank you to Lukas Huber and Michael Erharter my Professors  who are always willing to extend their help to the struggling but interested to learn students. 

### Discussion:

As almost everything is new to me, it is interesting to know and learn not only the requirements engineering, but also  design and architectural part of developing
a software, i find very complicated to understand in the beginning

### Summary:

Software development is for me the hardest and mostly mysterious area from our Data Science studies (at least in the first 2 semesters), so to be honest I had some fear regarding this project. Thanks to my collegues and they support it was possible to create this project and to contribute to it to some extend.

The idea of our project is to build an Cost analyzer application. I will not concentrate here on the details which can be found in the documents we created and shared for this project. In this summary I would like to describe the lessons learned and discuss our results and the outcome of the course from my point of view.

#### Lessons Learned and Discussion:

Requirements Engineering was from my side the easiest part of the course to understand, at least theoretically. The correct and state of the art implementation seems to be already much harder. For somebody, who never wrote such requirements it is hard to decide  what does it mean for instance specific enaugh formulation; for instance this  sentence: "The system will be offering different standard layout according to the preferences of the customers."  It ist specific enaugh? But how specific should it be? For me here the lesson learned is to think about the rules we have learned one shoud stick to writing the requirements. I think that only after some experience it is possible to do it well. 

Writing about the architecture was for me an interesting expierience, I have had really no/little understanding about this technical issues and what one has to implement so  that an architecture makes sense and functions well. So I tried to analyse what we have learned during the course ( or what I undestood from it) and I googled so that an architecture could have been  created for our application and at least in my understanding could work well and help to fulfill the requriements of our project. What I could learned from it, is the fact that one has to concentrate on the requirements thinking about an architecture, besides that a lot of ideas and concepts were here new for me and so I had a possibility to learned them also in an application form.  

Similar experience as described above was connected with defining and describing the data science architecture. It was a process of trying to understsand the material from the course and implement it to our application. It was again quite chellanging to think how it could work but also suprisingly quite interesting. 

For me the big lesson learned is that starting doing the projects nothing seems understandable for me and after that I`m still at the bigining but at least I see that it is not everything here a rockest science as it seems before.  

I think that for someone, who has no previous expierience (besides Sofware Development I and Data Engineering) in the topics of Software Development and never worked in this area, the course was quite chellanging, this was my expierience.    

It was very helpfull that we have  in the group collegues with much more expierience and better understanding in the area so one could ask for help and exchange the ideas.

So after the course I have the feeling to learned some important and interesting concepts. I think I can connect them and tell why they matters and build with them some theoretical solutions. For me even more chellanging is the application of this concepts (LAB).

### Summary: 

It was very interesting to work on this project *Cost Analyser App* to create more requirements and generate insights on new features. Basically I have already heard everything from the lecture, but often had no time to have a deeper look. To work in a heterogeneous team is very nice, because it get input from different sites. The Lab for Software Development was very challenging, time consuming, but very interesting to work with all the topics from the ILV. Designing a software is alway a very nice work and it would be possible to even find much more topic to specify in this project and for the *Cost Analyser*. Due to that we worked already a lot in the Lab we decided to have a focus on the theoretical parts of designing and architecting a software. 

We had a very good communication via Teams and Whats-App. We started working on Word and PPT documents, until we realized to provide the results via a GitLab. Therefore we switched to the GitLab repository https://gitlab.web.fh-kufstein.ac.at/christian.brandl/csv-cost-analyser-app-ilv/ and used also tickets to structure the goals and asign the tasks to different persons in the team. This worked out very well.

### Lessons Learned and Discussion

From the theory it was very useful to get an update on design patterns with good examples. This topic is always very difficult to understand and bring it then into real world scenarios. 

After the course I have got an update of important and interesting modern concepts. The project was very useful for persons new to this topic to get a fast overview of the needed tasks to specify a software development project for developers and also get an overview of the needed roles of a project team. For me it was a very good summary and reminder on modern architecture and also to use this again in my daily business. 

The big lesson learned for me was to get an update on best practice software design with modern tools. Best thinks for me where **Data Science Architektures** and working with Pipelines. This is a very interesting topic for me and I am looking forward to use this more in practice. Also **Container, Kuberenets and Cloud** is something a modern software developer has to know.
