With new technologies flooding every day, it is hard to keep up with all the updates. Blogs are a valuable resource for keeping up 
with recent innovations, communicating with fellow developers and getting a feel of what software development is all about.

This is where our motivation comes in. We have collected our software development portfolios aiming to walk you through
different areas of Software Development in Data Science with the help of the concept implementation of the CSV-Insurance Cost Analyzer App. In this 
blog, we learn and understand software development terms, concept and their application into solving real world problems. We covered Requirements 
Engineering & Evolution, Software System & Architecture and Software Design. Thus, covering  all the concept necessary to implementing an application 
or software.
